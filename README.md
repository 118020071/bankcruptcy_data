# bankcruptcy_data
Data is retrived from http://norma.ncirl.ie/4312/7/shantanudeshpandeconfigurationmanual.pdf, https://github.com/shantanudeshpande94/bankruptcy-prediction, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data#.
I have used column mean and row mean to fill in the missing value.
